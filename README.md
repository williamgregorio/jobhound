Goal >> Anonymous users checks on landing page of tool, for generation of new resume, if user wants to save information to let them create an account else ..
Why> While there a new jobs everyday, a new job is a new business with different cultures and needs. While it may be the same position we understand tailoring and targeting that specific business/client
will give you a higher percentage (*uncalculated*) of getting the deal/job

As you can see there is no direct targeting on who can benefit from this, it does seem like a person searching for a W-2 position may seek great results from this, so this will be the main agenda
